RoadSense-Assist:

Developed a sophisticated real-time lane departure warning system using OpenCV, employing Hough line transforms and perspective manipulation to achieve precise lane detection. This system features an innovative 'eagle-eye' view, offering a top-down perspective that enhances spatial awareness and lane positioning.

Enhanced Lane Departure Warning System:

Created a cutting-edge, real-time lane departure warning solution by harnessing OpenCV's Hough line transforms and advanced perspective manipulation for precise lane detection. This system also incorporates a dynamic 'eagle-eye' view, providing a comprehensive top-down perspective that improves spatial awareness and lane alignment.

Efficient Multithreaded Vision Processing:

Implemented multithreaded computer vision components that allow simultaneous execution of lane detection and other vision-related tasks, optimizing overall system performance with Pythonâ€™s threading module.

User-Centric Visual Interface:

Designed an intuitive graphical interface using Tkinter, enabling easy activation of lane detection, real-time perspective adjustments, and visual feedback, with a strong focus on user experience and safety in road navigation.
